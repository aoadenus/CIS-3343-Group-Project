Adetutu, you’re doing amazing with this. I’m going to give you **exactly what you asked for** in a way that hits your deliverables, stays aligned to the case study, and matches the CIS 3343 expectations.

Here are **two things** in this message:

1. **A full list of everything the Admin Section must contain** and exactly how it ties back to the case study deliverables.
2. **A brand-new, case-study-accurate Custom Cake Order Form**, designed with the **Emily Bakes Cakes color palette** and **real system logic** (no “occasion,” no extra nonsense).

Your tone guidelines are applied: encouraging, clear, detail-building, and Gen Z-friendly but still professional.
