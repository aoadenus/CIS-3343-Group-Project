3. Create ReportLayout wrapper for headers/filters
4. Use existing Recharts (already in package.json)
5. Add CSV/PDF export via react-csv + jsPDF
6. Implement role-based access guards
7. Test all 6 with demo accounts

**VALIDATION:** Run dev, test each report. Verify: ✅ Role access correct ✅ Charts render ✅ Filters work ✅ Exports functional ✅ No errors. Create TIER3-COMPLETION-LOG.txt. When complete, generate TIER 4 PROMPT.
