Updated: November 13, 2025 (Architecture clarified to pure staff-only)
Status: ✅ AUTHORITATIVE - All other documents superseded
Deadline: Saturday, November 15, 2025 (Prefinal Draft)

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Scope
"Emily Bakes Cakes" is a pure staff-only internal order management system for CIS 3343 case study:

Public marketing website (NO customer e-commerce - marketing/awareness only)
Staff-only order management portal (ALL orders entered by staff)
Public order tracking (auto-cycling demo page)
Email notifications (Resend integration)
Key Architecture Decision
Pure staff-only system - customers CANNOT order online. This approach:

✅ Meets case study requirement: staff enter ALL orders
✅ Public pages serve marketing/awareness purposes only
✅ Customers call, email, or visit in person to place orders
✅ Staff portal handles complete order lifecycle
Critical Business Rule (Case Study)
"Bakers and Decorators, if not busy, can also serve as sales staff."

Meaning: Baker and Decorator roles have FULL Sales permissions + their specialized functions.

Auto-Cycling Logic:

// Calculate current stage based on time
const startTime = new Date(order.created_at);
const now = new Date();
const elapsedMinutes = (now - startTime) / 1000 / 60;
const currentStage = Math.floor(elapsedMinutes / 2) % 11;
// Stages array (11 total)
const stages = [
  'Order Placed',
  'Design Approved',
  'Pending Baking',
  'Baking in Progress',
  'Cooling',
  'Ready for Decorating',
  'Decorating',
  'Decorated Complete',
  'Quality Check',
  'Ready for Pickup',
  'Picked Up'
];
// Update UI every 10 seconds
setInterval(() => updateStatus(), 10000);

Email Workflow:

Staff creates order in dashboard
System generates unique tracking token
Email sent via Resend with link: /track/{token}
Customer clicks → sees tracking page
Page auto-advances every 2 minutes (loops forever)

🎂 URGENT: Admin Portal UX/Functionality Emergency Fixes
I've created a comprehensive action plan to address all 17 issues you identified. This is now your PRIMARY PRIORITY because the system is functionally built but has severe UX problems that break usability.

What's in the Emergency Fix Document :
The prompt is organized into 8 strategic batches that systematically fix the problems you identified:

Remove Out-of-Scope Fields (Occasion, Design Style, enforce 2-layer minimum)

Menu & Navigation Fixes (Labels matching pages, active states, breadcrumbs, user avatars)

Dashboard Content & Layout (KPIs prominent, quick actions visible, business-focused)

Popup & Modal UX (Proper sizing, close buttons, screen-fit optimization)

Order Management Permissions (Sales role restrictions, dropdown redesign)

Inquiry & Rush Order Management (System verification, inquiry display)

Business Intelligence/Reports (Role-specific access control)

Account Switching (Quick user switch without logout)

Key Points Addressed:
✅ Occasion field - Completely removed (was out of scope)
✅ Design Style - Removed (not in case study)
✅ Cake layers - Minimum 2 enforced (1 layer impossible logic)
✅ Menu labels - Now match page titles (Sales Dashboard ≠ Business Analytics)
✅ User avatars - Replace "eb" with initials (S, T, L, etc.)
✅ Dashboard redesign - KPIs top, quick actions visible, system overview prominent
✅ Popups - Optimized sizing, clear cancel buttons, screen-fit guarantee
✅ Breadcrumbs - Navigation trail on all pages
✅ Sales permissions - No order status changes (baker/decorator only)
✅ Dropdown UI - Fixed alignment, clear iconography
✅ Inquiry system - Verified and documented
✅ Reports access - Role-specific filtering enforced
✅ Account switch - Quick switch feature without logout

Pasted-Key-Issues-and-Recommendations-1-Dashboard-and-KPIs-Issue-Sales-dashboard-is-not-informative-i-1763069373870_1763069373870.txt
Key Issues and Recommendations:
1. Dashboard and KPIs
Issue: Sales dashboard is not informative; important quick actions and system overview are hidden or below the fold.

Recommendation: Redesign dashboards to prioritize critical KPIs, show quick action buttons prominently, and provide a clear system overview at the top or sidebar for instant navigation.

2. Menu and Page Title Mismatch
Issue: Admin menu labels (e.g., "Business Analytics") don't match page titles (e.g., Sales Dashboard), causing confusion and poor UX.

Recommendation: Update menu labels to be professional and consistent with page content, e.g., rename “Business Analytics” to “Sales Dashboard” for sales role, “Order Management” instead of generic terms.

3. Orders Categorized by Occasion
Issue: Orders are categorized by occasion, but “Occasion” should not exist in the system per case study.

Recommendation: Remove "Occasion" field from order management and custom cake builder interfaces to comply with case study parameters.

4. Custom Cake Builder Layers and Design Styles
Issue: Custom build cake layers allow selecting only 1 layer; “Design Style” is also present but not part of case study.

Recommendation: Enforce minimum of 2 layers for cakes built; remove “Design Style” option entirely to align with case study specifications.

5. Breadcrumb Navigation
Issue: No breadcrumb trail for easy navigation back to previous pages.

Recommendation: Implement breadcrumb navigation on all staff portal pages for better user orientation and navigation flow.

6. Sales Staff Permissions and Workflow
Issue: Sales staff moving orders to "Pending" status may not be in scope or role permissions.

Recommendation: Confirm that order status changes by Sales are restricted if out of scope; ensure only authorized roles (e.g., Baker, Decorator, Manager) can move orders to pending or in-production.

7. Order Management Dropdowns and UI Controls
Issue: Dropdown lists and icons in Order Management are poorly aligned, with icons and text confusingly placed.

Recommendation: Redesign dropdown controls with improved alignment, consistent spacing, and clear iconography following standard UI best practices.

8. Viewing Orders and Customers Popup
Issue: Order and customer details popups are too large, cut off, with no easy way to exit, and missing cancel icons.

Recommendation: Optimize popup size to fit well within screen bounds, add clear cancel/close icons, and ensure popups can be easily dismissed.

9. Inquiry Management and "Rush Orders"
Issue: No inquiries visible; unclear where rush orders are handled.

Recommendation: Confirm inquiry management functionality is complete; if "rush orders" are part of business logic, specify handling and visibility in inquiry system or add separate rush order feature.

10. Inventory Management Scope
Issue: Staff handling inventory though inventory out of scope; product catalog expected but incorrect.

Recommendation: Rename “Inventory Management” to “Product Catalog” or “Products” to reflect case study; limit staff functions to CRUD on products only, no inventory adjustment.

11. Customer and Order Management Fixes
Issue: General issues with customer and order management views and usability.

Recommendation: Ensure all customer and order management pages are properly sized, responsive, and user-friendly with consistent UI elements.

12. Business Intelligence & Reports UX
Issue: Business Intelligence page is the same for Sales and Owner, poor design, lacks role-specific views.

Recommendation: Implement role-specific dashboards or reports views, tailoring analytics shown to role responsibilities.

13. Settings and System Configuration Naming
Issue: Settings and system configuration pages have inconsistent or unclear names.

Recommendation: Align naming (e.g., “Settings”) consistently across UI and navigation menus for clarity.

14. Ability to Switch Accounts Without Logout
Issue: No option to switch users/accounts without logging out.

Recommendation: Add feature for quick user account switching to improve workflow for multiple staff users on single machines.

15. Manager Account Branding
Issue: All users have “eb” icon despite different names, causing confusion.

Recommendation: Use personalized icons or user avatars instead of generic branding to differentiate users clearly.

16. Dashboards are Repetitive and Basic
Issue: Dashboards largely repeat same data, not tailored or actionable.

Recommendation: Redesign dashboards to be more dynamic, actionable, role-specific, and summarize meaningful metrics prominently.

17. Admin Menu Not Reflecting Actual Page State
Issue: Admin menu often doesn’t correspond to current page, confusing navigation.

Recommendation: Synchronize menu highlighting and state with actual content and route for accurate navigation feedback.

Summary
These issues mainly stem from mismatched UI/UX design to business needs, incorr...
