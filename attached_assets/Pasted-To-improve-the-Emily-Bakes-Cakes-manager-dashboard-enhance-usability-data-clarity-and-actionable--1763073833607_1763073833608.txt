To improve the Emily Bakes Cakes manager dashboard, enhance usability, data clarity, and actionable insights for all bakery staff. Consider the following evidence-based recommendations specific to your prototype and course requirements.

Key Areas for Dashboard Improvement
Make Critical Data Instantly Visible
Add stat cards for daily orders, orders in progress, and total revenue. Cards should update in real time and function as links to filtered lists.​

Display "Ready for Pickup" orders in a prominent list, limited to top 5, with customer name and pickup time. Add status color badges for clarity.​

Introduce Activity and Alerts
Add a recent activity feed showing order creation, status changes, and customer updates; limit display to last 5 actions.​

Use notification toasts for errors, important updates, or confirmation of actions (e.g., order creation).​

Empower Quick Actions and Navigation
Add quick-access buttons for common tasks: "Create Order," "View All Orders," and "System Settings".​

Ensure stat cards and lists are clickable for quick navigation to details.​

Enhance Analytics and Reporting
Integrate flexible date range filter for revenue, orders, and customer stats (Today, Week, Month, Custom).​

Add export and print options for managers to easily produce reports or CSV summaries for revenue, orders, and customers.​

Visualize Data Trends and Status
Use line/bar charts for revenue trends and pie charts for orders by status, all filterable by date range.​

Provide a top customer ranking table, showing repeated customers and overall spending.​

User Interface and Accessibility Upgrades
Apply Brand Guidelines and Contrast
Use the project’s color palette, font stack, and button specs to preserve brand consistency and accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA).​

Ensure status indicators use both color and text to be accessible to colorblind users.​

Optimize Responsiveness and Interaction
For mobile users, display stat cards and orders in a single column. Make all touch targets at least 48px for easy use.​

Enable keyboard navigation for all dashboard components and logical tab order so staff can move quickly through actions.​

Loading States and Feedback
Add skeleton screens and progress indicators while loading stats, orders, or reports to improve perceived performance.​

Actionable Next Steps
Start by prioritizing dashboard changes that align with rubric enhancements: more actionable KPIs, improved data filtering, and direct access to reports.

Review the UI Style Guide for any design inconsistencies, and ensure all updates maintain brand standards.​

Test across devices, with special attention to mobile responsiveness and accessibility for staff with disabilities.​

Implementing these changes will make your dashboard more functional, actionable, and accessible while exceeding CIS 3343 deliverable requirements and providing a polished user experience for bakery staff and managers.​
