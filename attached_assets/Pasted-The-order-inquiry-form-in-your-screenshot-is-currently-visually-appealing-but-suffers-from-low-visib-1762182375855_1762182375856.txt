The order inquiry form in your screenshot is currently visually appealing but suffers from low visibility and requires scrolling, which can negatively impact user experience on desktop. To fix these issues as a UX designer, consider the following recommendations:

Make the Form More Visible
Use a lighter or contrasting background for the form panel itself to make it stand out further from the blurred content behind it.

Add a subtle drop shadow or border around the form container to increase depth and separation from the background.

Increase the font size and weight for section headers (“Cake Inquiry”) and field labels so they’re scannable at a glance.

Provide more padding around the text and input fields for a cleaner look and easier interaction.​

Add Clear Instructions
Place a brief friendly instruction at the top (e.g., “Please fill out this quick form to order your cake. Fields marked * are required.”).

Add inline hints or placeholders on each field specifying the expected format (e.g., for phone: “555-123-4567”).

Show real-time validation or error messages for incorrect or missing entries as users fill out the form.

Clearly indicate required fields, ideally with an asterisk and/or color.​

Eliminate Scrolling (Fit on Desktop View)
Consider making labels and input fields aligned horizontally (label left of the input) instead of stacking vertically, especially for shorter fields like “Event Date” and “Phone Number”.

Reduce the vertical padding/margin between input fields.

Use two-column layout for the form to condense space—for example:

Column 1: Name / Email

Column 2: Phone / Date

Place the “Additional Details” box at the bottom and limit its visible height (let it expand on focus if needed).​

Example Layout Improvements
Issue	Solution
Low contrast	Lighter background, distinct border/shadow
Hard to scan labels	Bolder fonts, increase size, horizontal alignment
Too tall for screen	Two-column layout, reduced padding, condensed fields
Lacking guidance	Add instruction, real-time validation/hints
UX Guidelines Summary
Visual clarity is critical: Your form should pop visually yet integrate with your brand.

Minimize effort: All necessary fields should fit on a typical desktop (usually < 700px height), with logical grouping and alignment.

Reduce friction: Use real-time feedback and clear instructions so users know exactly what to do at every step.​

These improvements will make your inquiry form much more user-friendly, visible, and efficient, minimizing drop-off and frustration.
