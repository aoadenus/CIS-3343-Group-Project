1. PUBLIC WEBSITE (Marketing Site) FIXES

These are all external-facing pages. They do not interact with the staff system.

1.1 Shop Page Filters Are Wrong

Issue: Filters show birthday, wedding, seasonal, etc.
Fix: Replace with

All cakes

Flavor

Filling

Color
Why: Case study product catalog = cakes only. Categories like Birthday/Wedding are not part of the system’s scope.

1.2 “Call to order” + “Email us” Buttons Must Link to Contact Page

Currently linking externally.
Fix: Direct them to internal Contact page.
Reason: Better UX + consistent navigation.

1.3 About Page: Misaligned Box Layout

Your partner can fix, but you correctly identified this requires visual layout correction.

1.4 Contact Page: “How Ordering Works” Box Is Oversized

Fix: Move “How ordering works” to left and vertically stack the contact info on the right.
Why: Accessibility and priority of information.

1.5 Hide Login Button for Customers

Fix:

Remove staff login from top nav.

Only show via hamburger menu on right.
Reason: Access control clarity + avoids customers accidentally entering staff portal.

1.6 Google Maps Missing

Fix: Add proper Google Maps iframe or API snippet.

2. STAFF LOGIN & AUTHENTICATION
2.1 Demo Password Text Too Small

Fix: Enlarge demo password UI and move upward.
Why: Usability for testing, professor accessibility.

2.2 After Logout, Staff Should Return to Staff Login (NOT the public website)

Fix:

Logout redirects → /staff/login
Why: System is an internal staff app, not customer-facing.

2.3 Switch-User Functionality (Requested)

Issue: No “Switch Accounts” option.
Fix: Add a “Switch User” without full logout.
Why: Supports store workflow (“baker steps away, manager takes over quickly”).

3. MANAGER (EMILY + JAMES) DASHBOARD ISSUES
3.1 Create Order Button Crashes

Error: React 19 useContext basename issue.
Fix: Update routing + provider structure.
Priority: Emergency. Without this, you cannot demonstrate order creation.

3.2 Missing Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs appear in some pages but missing in others.

Fix:

Global breadcrumb component

Auto-generated based on router
Why: Professor explicitly required breadcrumb navigation.

3.3 Dropdown Menus Have Wrong Icon Sizes & Alignment

Fix:

Larger icons

Consistent left/right alignment

Standard Radix UI / Headless UI dropdown patterns
Why: Required by professor UI critique.

3.4 Too Much Positive White Space

This applies to dashboards, forms, and reports.

Fix:

Reduce padding

Use tighter card layouts

Decrease empty sections
Why: Business dashboard usability + professor hates unnecessary scrolling.

4. ORDER MANAGEMENT: CRITICAL PROBLEMS

This is the most important deliverable and currently the most broken.

4.1 Create Order Form Cannot Submit

You repeatedly got:
“Missing required fields”
with no highlight, no message, no field identification.

Fix Requirements

Field-level validation

Inline errors

Scroll-to-error behavior

Disable submit until requirements met

Why This Matters

Order creation is the core mandatory requirement in the case study. If it fails, the project fails.

4.2 Layer Builder – Not Aligned With Case Study Rules

Your findings are accurate.

Fix List

“Double layer / Max layers” incorrect

Terminology mismatched

Some flavor lists incomplete

Fillings and icings must use dropdown menus

Special notes functioning but layout sloppy

Case Study Requirements

Exactly these flavors

Maximum TWO fillings (same flavor)

Each layer must align with real cake layering rules

Layer 1 is always the bottom

4.3 Colors Section Problems

You noticed too much spacing + missing/incorrect colors.

Must Fix

Remove pink from primary

Remove peach from pastel

Remove purple and lime from neon

Remove burgundy

Add white

Bold hex codes

Fix grid spacing
Why: Must match case study color sheet exactly.

4.4 Decorations Are Incorrect + Missing

You were 100% correct: decorations must match the case study list exactly.

Fix

All decorations must be present

Change scattered list → structured dropdowns by category

Add tiny icon images

Edible sugar photos must allow file upload (case study requires it)

Toys must be grouped, example:

Toys → {Dinosaurs, Race cars, Trains, Dolls…}

4.5 Rush-Order Flow is Broken
Fix Requirements

If pickup date < 2 days, pop up RUSH WARNING

Managers (Emily + James) can override

Sales cannot approve rush orders
Reason: Case study rule.

4.6 Serve Count Field Should Be Removed

Why: Serve count is determined by cake size. Not a required input.

4.7 Order Status Flow Wrong for Sales

In your walkthrough, sales staff can change statuses. This violates the business process.

Correct Flow

Sales staff: create orders only

Bakers: update “Baking” and “Assembled”

Decorators: update “Decorating / Completed”

Emily or James: final approval

5. CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT ISSUES
5.1 Customer Popup Appears Top-Left and Cut Off

Fix: Center modal, full visibility, scrollable.

5.2 CRUD Incomplete

Edits fail

Updates fail

No delete safeguards
Fix: Rebuild customer CRUD with correct API calls.

5.3 Preferred Customer Status Incorrect

Case study says:

Preferred customers only = 10% discount

Corporate vs Retail required
Fix: Remove “VIP” entirely. Use:
Retail | Corporate | Preferred

6. PRODUCT CATALOG ISSUES (ADMIN + STAFF)
6.1 Should Be Called “Product Management,” Not “Product Catalog”

Admin needs CRUD; catalog term misleading.

6.2 CRUD Not Working

You tested edit/update: it fails.
Fix: Repair PUT route + validation.

6.3 Popularity Scale Wrong

Change 0–100 → 1–5 stars.

6.4 Category List Wrong

Case study categories are:

Cakes

Pastries

Cupcakes

Cookies

Petit Fours

Pies

Breads

Seasonal
Not birthday, wedding, etc.

7. REPORTS & ANALYTICS FIXES
7.1 Charts Too Large → Too Much Scroll

Fix spacing + reduce chart size.

7.2 Reports Should Have Breadcrumbs

Currently missing.

7.3 Sales Staff Should NOT See Full Revenue Reports

They currently do.
Fix by role-based permission.

8. ROLE-BASED DASHBOARD FIXES
8.1 Sales Dashboard

Issues you identified:

Too much white space

Wrong access (reports, fulfillment board)

Should show today’s orders, quick actions, common tasks only

8.2 Baker Dashboard

Bakers should NOT:

Change financial details

Use product CRUD

See financial reports
They should:

See queue of cakes to bake

Update status to “Baked / Assembled”

8.3 Decorator Dashboard

Same as baker, but for decoration tasks:

Should have “Needs Clarification” requests

Should upload completed cake photo

Should NOT have revenue, CRUD, analytics, or IT functions

8.4 Accountant Dashboard

You were right to expect more here.
Current version is too generic.

Dan needs:

Deposits overview

Payments pending

Balance due

Weekly & monthly summaries

Downloadable financial statements

Customer refund history (optional)

He should not have:

Fulfillment board

Decorative or baking tools

Product CRUD

9. CASE STUDY CORRECTIONS YOU IDENTIFIED

All correct and must be applied across the app:

Emily’s last name is Boudreaux, not Baker

System must store email/phone lists for marketing

Orders must track “last employee who touched it”

Prices for decorated cakes are negotiable

→ Add “negotiated price override” field

Cupcake customization must place filling at top center

2-day rule for custom orders must be implemented

Corporate customers may have multiple locations

Photos must be uploadable

Optional updated website is separate from internal system

Inventory is NOT in scope

10. MISSING FEATURES THAT MUST BE ADDED
10.1 Staff Scheduling

Case study strongly implies scheduling, staffing, performance tracking.

10.2 Order Alerts for Bakers/Decorators

When an order arrives:

Baker notified

Decorator notified

Emily/James notified for final approval
Could be in-app notifications or a small internal alert queue.

10.3 Emergency / Disaster Recovery File Button

You mentioned this correctly.
Fix: Add a “Download All Files” button for managers.

10.4 Corporate Customer Multiple Location Support

Add sub-table for locations.

10.5 Standard Cake “Auto-Fill”

If user selects a standard cake, layers and icing should auto-populate.

11. GLOBAL DESIGN + UX FIXES
11.1 Reduce Positive Space

Every dashboard and board needs tighter layout.

11.2 Dynamic Dropdown Menus Everywhere

Professor requires this.

11.3 Standardization of UI Components

Use one component library (Radix UI or ShadCN).
Right now spacing, dropdowns, modals, card sizes are inconsistent.

11.4 Partner Tasks You Identified

About Page visuals

Contact page layout

Front-end animations

Button placements

Gallery updates
