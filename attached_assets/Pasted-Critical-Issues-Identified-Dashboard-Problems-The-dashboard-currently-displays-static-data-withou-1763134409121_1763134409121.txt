Critical Issues Identified
Dashboard Problems:
The dashboard currently displays static data without real-time updates, and the KPI stat cards are not clickable—meaning users cannot navigate to filtered data views. The "Orders Ready for Pickup" list shows minimal information (missing phone numbers and payment status), making pickup coordination inefficient. Recent activity is too generic and doesn't highlight critical or urgent events.

Employee/Staff Management Gaps:
The Staff Management page is severely underdeveloped—it's essentially just a staff directory list. It lacks:

Performance tracking system (no metrics, no scores, no productivity analysis)

Scheduling capabilities (no shift management, no calendar view, no coverage analysis)

Performance-based recognition (no achievements, no top performer recognition)

Staff visibility into their own performance (no personal dashboards)

No time-off request system or payroll integration

Missing Required Functionality:
Six critical business reports required by the case study are not yet built (Order Summary, Customer List, Revenue, Pending Orders, Completed Orders, Product Inventory). Email notifications are completely absent—customers receive no order confirmations or tracking links. Quality control workflows don't exist, rush order management isn't implemented, and advanced order search/filtering is limited.

User Experience Issues:
No loading states or progress indicators during data fetch operations, insufficient error messaging, unclear mobile responsiveness, and accessibility concerns. The public website has broken call-to-action buttons that should be removed (since this is a staff-only system, not customer e-commerce).

Implementation Roadmap
The detailed analysis document above provides specific technical requirements for every issue, implementation code examples, and a prioritized roadmap. Tier 1 priorities (this week) include building the 6 reports, fixing public CTAs, making KPI cards clickable, and implementing real-time dashboard updates.

Tier 2 priorities (week 2) focus on the employee management system overhaul: building the Staff Performance Dashboard (Page 34 in wireframes), implementing Resend email integration, creating the Production Calendar, and enhancing the ready-for-pickup list with full context.

Specific Staff Management Enhancements Needed
The employee page must be transformed into a comprehensive Staff Management Hub with five major sections:

Staff Directory Enhancement: Add last login, hours this week, performance score, and availability status. Replace the basic edit with a comprehensive modal including phone, start date, and availability scheduling.

Performance Dashboard: Display role-specific metrics (orders created for sales, cakes completed for bakers, decoration quality scores for decorators). Show weekly performance comparisons using bar charts, individual performance cards with scores (0-100), and trend indicators showing improvement/stability/decline.

Production Scheduling: Add a 4-week rolling calendar with drag-and-drop shift assignment, color-coded by role, conflict detection, and coverage analysis. Include time-off request management and payroll integration that auto-calculates hours.

Quality Metrics & Accountability: Track and display each staff member's quality scores, customer satisfaction ratings, on-time completion rates, and historical performance trends. Enable managers to record coaching notes and recognize achievements.

Recognition & Growth: Add performance-based bonuses tied to metrics, achievement badges, employee-of-the-month recognition, and structured annual performance review capability.

Quick Wins for Immediate Impact
Make KPI cards clickable (2-hour fix): Clicking "Today's Orders" filters to today's orders; clicking "In Progress" shows active production

Enhance ready-for-pickup list (3-hour fix): Add phone number, payment status, "Call Customer" button, "Mark Picked Up" action

Add real-time dashboard (4-hour fix): WebSocket updates every 5 seconds with visual "Live" indicator

Categorize recent activity (2-hour fix): Color-code by type (Blue=Created, Purple=Status, Green=Payment, Red=Issue)

Build first report (6-hour fix): Start with Order Summary report using Recharts bar chart

The full implementation roadmap in the attached document provides technical specifications, code examples, success metrics, and a realistic timeline for completion. Focus on Tier 1 and Tier 2 items to meet course requirements and significantly improve system usability within the next two weeks.
