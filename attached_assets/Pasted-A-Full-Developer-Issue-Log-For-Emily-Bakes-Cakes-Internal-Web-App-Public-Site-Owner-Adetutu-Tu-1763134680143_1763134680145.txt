Status: To Do

A-02

Severity: High

Component: Login Visibility (Public vs Staff)

Issue: Staff login is visible prominently in the main navigation for customers.

Required Change: Remove staff login from the main public navbar. Only show staff login in an unobtrusive location (e.g. small link in footer, or a “Staff” link inside a hamburger menu).

Status: To Do

A-03

Severity: Medium

That’s the Issue Log (A) done.

B. Replit AI / Perplexity Prompt Pack

Short, queue-friendly prompts you can paste directly.
Idea: Each prompt focuses on a cluster of issues using the IDs from the log.

You can prefix all of them with this master context snippet once per workspace:

You are helping implement the “Emily Bakes Cakes” internal custom order management system and public marketing site for a CIS 3343 class project. Follow the case-study rules strictly: staff-only order entry, 2-day rule for custom orders (manager override only), correct product categories, correct cake sizes, flavors, fillings, icing, decorations, and role-based dashboards (Sales, Baker, Decorator, Manager/Owner, Accountant). Use the issue IDs I mention (A-01, B-01, etc.) as the source of truth for what to fix.

Now the chunked prompts:

Prompt B1: Fix Create Order Flow and Validation (B-01, B-02, B-04, B-05, B-06, C-01)

Implement the following fixes in the staff Order Creation flow for “Emily Bakes Cakes”.

Fix the “Create Order” navigation crash from the manager/admin dashboard (issue B-02). Ensure React Router context and any basename/useContext assumptions are correct so a manager can click “Create Order” and land on the order form reliably.

Implement proper form validation (issue B-01):

Every required field must be explicitly validated.

On submit, show clear inline error messages next to each invalid field.

Scroll to the first invalid field.

Disable the submit button while there are validation errors or while the form is submitting.

Apply the 2-day rush-order rule (issue B-04):

If the requested pickup date is within 2 days of the current date, show a modal saying this is a rush order and requires a manager override.

Only users with the Manager/Owner role (Emily or James) can confirm the rush order; others must cancel or change the date.

Remove any manual “Serve count” field and instead derive serving estimates from cake size (issue B-05). If you display “Serves X–Y,” use the exact mapping from the case-study cake sizes.

Add a backend field and UI display for “last_updated_by” whenever an order status or key order detail is changed (issue B-06). Show this in the order detail view for managers.

In the layer builder, enforce the rule that each cake layer can have no filling, one filling, or at most two layers of the same filling flavor (issue C-01). Show the rule text near the layer UI and block submission if violated.

Explain in comments which code sections implement each issue ID so I can cross-reference with my issue log.

Prompt B2: Role-Based Dashboards and Permissions (F-01 to F-05, G-03)

Update all staff dashboards to enforce strict role-based access as described: Sales, Baker, Decorator, Manager/Owner (Emily & James), and Accountant (Dan). Align with these issues: F-01, F-02, F-03, F-04, F-05, and G-03.

Requirements:

Sales Dashboard (F-01):

Show: Today’s orders, New Order button, Customer lookup, Pick-up schedule.

Hide: financial reports, product CRUD, staff management, and order fulfillment board controls.

Baker Dashboard (F-02):

Show: Baking queue, orders that are in “Baking” or “Ready to bake”, basic order details.

Hide: revenue charts, marketing exports, and product/customer CRUD.

Decorator Dashboard (F-03):

Show: Decoration queue, design notes, uploaded inspiration images, ability to set “Decorated / Completed” status.

Hide: financial data and admin tools.

Manager/Owner Dashboard (F-05, B-04, B-06):

Show: overview metrics (orders, revenue summary), approvals for rush orders, approvals for completed cakes, access to product and customer management, staff scheduling/overview.

Accountant Dashboard (F-04, G-03):

Show: deposits, balances due, payment status, weekly and monthly financial summaries, exportable financial reports.

Hide: fulfillment boards and non-financial controls.

Restrict detailed revenue and financial reports to Manager/Owner and Accountant roles only (G-03).

Implement this as:

Centralized role-based access control,

Guarded routes or feature flags per role,

Tests or comments confirming each dashboard only renders permitted widgets for that role.

Prompt B3: Customer & Product Management (D-01 to D-05, E-01 to E-04)

Implement the following changes to Customer Management and Product Management, using the case study as the source of truth, and mapping to issues D-01 through D-05 and E-01 through E-04.

Customer Management:

Fix customer edit/update API calls and UI flows so updates reliably save and display confirmation (D-01).

Replace any “VIP” or inconsistent labels with explicit fields:

customer_type: “Retail” or “Corporate”.

is_preferred: boolean indicating eligibility for a 10 percent discount (D-02).

Support multiple locations for corporate customers by adding a CustomerLocation entity/table with address, phone, and a foreign key to Customer (D-04).

Provide a marketing list export: views or endpoints to get email and phone lists for selected filters (e.g., preferred only, corporate only) (D-05).

Fix customer detail modal layout so it is centered, fully visible, and scrollable on small screens (D-03).

Product Management:
6. Fix product edit/update logic and ensure that changes persist correctly (E-01).
7. Rename the internal staff section “Product Catalog” to “Product Management” in the staff app, but keep “Shop” for customers on the public site (E-02).
8. Change the popularity field from a 0–100 numeric scale to a 1–5 star rating with clear display components (E-03).
9. Enforce product categories exactly as defined in the case study: Cakes, Pastries, Cupcakes, Cookies, Petit Fours, Pies, Breads, Seasonal Products (E-04). Ensure there are no “Birthday/Wedding” style categories in staff product management.

Show me which files you touched and annotate key changes with the corresponding issue IDs as comments.

Prompt B4: Public Website UX Fixes (H-01 to H-05, I-01, I-02)

Apply the following UX and content fixes to the public marketing site (not the staff portal), for issues H-01 to H-05, I-01, I-02.

Shop page filters (H-01):

Replace occasion-based filters with: All, Flavor, Filling, Color, Seasonal.

Call-to-action buttons (H-02):

Ensure “Call to order” and “Email us” buttons are wired to the Contact page (and phone/mail actions where appropriate), not random external or dead links.

About page layout (H-03):

Fix misaligned content boxes. Use a clean, centered grid with consistent spacing and typography.

Contact page layout (H-04):

Move “How ordering works” to the left column and stack the actual contact information (address, phone, email, hours) in a right column or stacked layout.

Map integration (H-05):

Embed a map showing the bakery’s location.

Global white space and component styling (I-01, I-02):

Reduce excessive vertical spacing on public pages.

Standardize dropdowns, modals, and buttons using the same design system as the staff app.

Comment the main layout changes and note which issue each one addresses.

Prompt B5: Decorations, Colors, Inspiration Upload (C-02 to C-06)

Fix the decorations and colors system for the order builder, aligned with the case-study list and issues C-02 through C-06.

Standard cake patterns (C-02):

When a user selects a named standard cake, auto-fill the base cake flavor and icing flavor according to the case study (e.g., Italian Cream, Lemon Doberge, etc.), while still allowing overrides if needed.

Colors (C-03, C-04):

Replace the current color sets with a set that exactly matches the case-study icing and writing colors.

Remove pink from primary, remove extra pastel/neon colors not defined in the case study, remove burgundy, and add white where needed.

Use a compact, responsive color grid with color swatches and bold hex codes.

Decorations (C-05):

Implement a canonical decorations list from the case study: buttercream flowers, fondant decorations, silk flowers, toy trains, plastic dinosaurs, various dolls, plastic sports equipment, etc.

Group them by category: Flowers, Toys, Plastic Figures, Seasonal, Miscellaneous.

Use multi-select-friendly UI.

Inspiration image upload (C-06):

Add a file upload field to the order form (e.g., “Upload inspiration image / reference photo”).

Store the files and show links or thumbnails in the Baker and Decorator dashboards.

Annotate code changes with comments referencing each issue ID.

Those are enough prompts to push through the bulk of your issue log in Replit/Perplexity (B done).
