Comprehensive Website Refactor and Fix Prompt
Goal
Fix the website’s functionality (no more blank screen) while preserving the design and improving UX.
DIAGNOSE & REMOVE: Systematically review the current components (e.g. Home.tsx, PublicLayout.tsx, App.tsx) and identify all complex or unstable code causing issues. In particular, remove or fully comment out the animated Welcome Screen and its related state logic, since this likely causes the blank screen bug. Simplify the welcome section into a static banner or logo (the user will provide a transparent logo image) – or remove it entirely if necessary – to ensure the site loads quickly (nearly half of users expect a site to load in under 2 seconds

). Eliminating these heavy animations will improve load time and reliability, especially on Replit’s hosting.
REBUILD: Re-write the structural components using standard, stable React patterns and Tailwind CSS for styling. Avoid any exotic dependencies or overly complex state management that could conflict with the Replit/Vite environment. In practice, this means favoring simple React hooks and Tailwind utility classes over heavy external UI libraries (only use minimal, well-supported libraries if absolutely needed). The goal is to use proven, lightweight solutions known to work reliably on Replit – for example, standard React Router for navigation and basic Tailwind CSS for layout – to minimize potential compatibility issues.
PRESERVE DESIGN: Maintain the visual hierarchy, layout, and branding from the original Figma design as much as possible. The refactored code should keep the overall look and feel: the Public layout structure, the navigation bar placement, and the color palette must remain intact. Ensure all fonts, colors, and spacing match the original design so the site still looks like the “Make” website. If the animated welcome screen is removed or simplified, replace it with a static welcome banner or the provided logo image on a neutral background, so that the branding remains visible without the performance cost of animation. In short, the site’s aesthetics and UI components should be consistent with the original design (buttons, links, headers, etc.), just implemented in a more stable way.
ROUTES & NAVIGATION: Preserve all current pages and routes (Home, Shop, Builder, Gallery, About, etc.) and make sure navigation works seamlessly. Every menu link or button should be clickable and lead to the correct page – for example, ensure the Shop button actually navigates to the Shop page, the Builder link goes to the Builder page, and so on. Repair or implement any missing routing logic so that the user can move through the site intuitively. This also means using React Router (or a similar routing solution) properly, and possibly adding fallback routes or error boundaries to avoid any blank pages. Clear navigation paths are important for a good UX – intuitive menus with proper links will lower user frustration

. Make the navigation bar consistent across pages (e.g. always visible and indicating the current page) to further improve usability.
UX PRINCIPLES: Refactor with well-researched UX design principles in mind, focusing on accessibility, responsiveness, and usability. Use semantic HTML5 elements for structure (proper headings, lists, landmarks) and ensure the site is accessible – for example, provide descriptive alt text for images, use ARIA labels or roles when appropriate, and make sure interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields) are reachable via keyboard with clear focus states (visible focus outlines). Keep the interface simple and consistent across pages, as simplicity helps users find what they need quickly

. Ensure the design is fully mobile-responsive so it looks and works great on all screen sizes, since over half of web traffic is on mobile and responsive sites tend to load faster

. Optimize for fast loading and minimal glitches – users will leave if a site is confusing or slow to load

. In practice, this means trimming any unnecessary features that don’t add value, using efficient assets (optimized images, clean code), and following accessibility best practices (e.g. sufficient color contrast, readable fonts, adequate touch target sizes). By adhering to these UX principles, the refactored site will be more user-friendly, inclusive, and performant.
VERIFY: After implementing the above changes, thoroughly test the website on Replit’s full network host URL. Ensure that the blank screen issue is resolved – the home page and all other pages should load without errors. Verify that all interactions (navigation links, buttons, page transitions) work correctly and that the site retains its core visual design from the original (no unexpected layout shifts or missing styles). The website should now load within a couple of seconds and run smoothly, providing a solid user experience with the original design’s look. Finally, provide only the finalized code for the files that were changed (e.g. updated Home.tsx, PublicLayout.tsx, App.tsx, etc.) as the output. The code should be ready to replace the old code, so avoid extra commentary – just deliver the refactored code for each affected file in a clean format that can be directly used.
By following this prompt, the AI will refactor the website’s code to fix the blank screen bug and align with UX best practices, all while preserving the majority of the original design. The end result will be a perfectly running site on Replit that looks like the Figma design but behaves with the stability and usability of a professionally developed website.
