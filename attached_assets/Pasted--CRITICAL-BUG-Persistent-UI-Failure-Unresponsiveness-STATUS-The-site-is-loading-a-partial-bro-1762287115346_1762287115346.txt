🚨 CRITICAL BUG: Persistent UI Failure & Unresponsiveness
STATUS: The site is loading a partial, broken shell on the external URL. The core issues are:

Invisible/Missing Content: Only a few basic elements (main heading, button, lines) are visible. The main component lists, images, and full structure are missing.

Unclickable/Unresponsive: The menu and other elements are non-functional, and the page eventually becomes unresponsive and fails to fully load.

Scrollable Screen: The viewport scrolls, but the lack of content confirms a rendering or asset failure.

MANDATORY INSTRUCTION: DO NOT STOP until the entire application is fully functional, all elements are visible, and all interactions are responsive in ALL views (Replit Preview, Desktop External URL, and Mobile View).

🔍 PHASE 1: Asset and Styling Build Diagnosis
Tailwind CSS Check (Highest Priority):

Diagnosis: The lack of styling and components strongly suggests Tailwind CSS is not loading or is not being correctly processed/built.

Action:

Confirm the Tailwind build script is running before the server starts.

Check the Network tab on the external URL for a 404 error on the main CSS bundle (e.g., main.css).

Inspect the <head> of index.html to ensure the CSS link is correct and points to the right build directory, likely /assets/index.css.

External URL Asset Path Re-Verification:

Action: Re-audit vite.config.ts. Ensure the base property is correctly set to handle the Replit environment's dynamic URL structure. Test setting base: './' again, which often forces relative pathing for all assets and resolves this issue.

💻 PHASE 2: Performance and Interaction Fixes
Console Error Root Cause:

Diagnosis: The "unresponsive" error indicates a severe CPU/Memory spike, usually an Infinite Rendering Loop or a Resource Hog.

Action: Isolate the component that is failing to load (e.g., the product list or carousel component). Add a temporary console.time('Component Render') to key components and check the logs on the external URL to pinpoint which one is running excessively or failing completely.

Interaction/Clickability Test:

Diagnosis: If a component or div is overlapping the entire screen with a high z-index, it can block clicks.

Action: Use browser Dev Tools (Elements/Styles tab) to temporarily disable any high z-index rules or position: absolute/fixed elements applied globally to the main app container that might be causing an invisible overlay.

✅ PHASE 3: Functional Verification
The AI MUST confirm the following after the fix before stopping:

Full Visibility: All components, text, and images are fully visible and styled correctly.

Responsiveness: All menu links, buttons, and tabs are clickable and respond instantly.

Stability: The page never shows the "unresponsive" error and loads fully within 5 seconds.

Cross-View Check: Site is 100% functional on the Replit Preview, the Desktop External URL, and Mobile Device Emulation.
