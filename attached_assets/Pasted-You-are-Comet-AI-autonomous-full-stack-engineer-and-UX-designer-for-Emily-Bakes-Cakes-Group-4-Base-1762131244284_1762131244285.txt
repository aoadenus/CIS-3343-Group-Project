Check UI/UX including color palette, typography (Playfair Display + Poppins), spacing, responsiveness, shadows, and gradients for bakery aesthetic.

Verify BUTTONS, LINKS, DROPDOWNS, SEARCH BARS, and FORMS for interactivity and proper event binding.

Assess hero banner and scroll UX for smooth parallax, fade-in animation, and mobile comfort.

Test all back-end API routes (/api/customers, /api/orders, /api/products) for realistic JSON with mock or seeded data.

Build or verify Tableau-like dashboards with Recharts or Chart.js: Daily Orders, Customer Feedback, Product Popularity charts connected to fake data.

Simulate database using local JSON or SQLite and seed realistic fake data.

Check accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support) across breakpoints 360px to 1920px.

Deliverables Translation

Convert ERD/Data Dictionary to data models or mock JSON.
