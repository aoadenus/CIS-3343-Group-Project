issues i am having with current prototype admin section. i thoroughly tested the staff application and i have a lot of issues. it seems to be cute but not functional. the kpis are just there, the charts are good, but important info is lost at the bottom such as quick links. Th quick actions are hidden system overview is hiddeen. sales dashboard is non informative really/ the menu doesnt match the page title still why is it sales dashboard title and then the admin menu is saying business analytics why is it bad design and not business like, its trying to be so cute it doesnt work like it should. ORDERS SHOULD NOT BE CATEGORIZED BY OCCASION. OCCASION SHOULD NOT EXIST AS AN OPTION ON CUSTOM CAKE BUILDER. REMOVE OCCASION. CUSTOM BUILD CAKE LAYERS IS NOT DESIGNED WITH STANDARD MENU AND OPTIONS THIS IS NO GOOD. DESIGN STYLE IS NOT A THING AT EMILY BAKES CAKES THAT IS NOT IN SCOPE OR CASE STUDY . THERE SHOULD BE A BREADCRUMB TRAIL TO GO BACK EASILY . ASL THIS QUESTION SHOULD SALES STAFF BE MOVING ORDERS TO PENDING IN THIS SYSTEM, IS THAT IN THEIR SCOPE? NO please update two things in order managemnt bord the cakes does not matter the occasion 1 layer is impossible it must be at least2 that is logic. then edit and hostory is fine. but waht is in sales scope. order managemnet the drop down lists should be better designed not that the icon and text is far right then there is a weird icoon and hard to see on the far left. viewing orders and customers is broken either its cut off has weird placemnt i cant see it, its too bis, i cant exit from it, please optimize middle pop up structure with cancel icon adn sizing within the screen. INQUIRY WHY WE HAVE NO INQUIRIES IN OUR SITE WHERE IS RUSH ORDER STUFF. THIS IS WILD??? inventory management should staff be handling inventory no inventory is out of scope so really itd a product catalog and MY PRODUCTS ARE SUPPOSED STANDARD BUT THAT HASNT BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND IS WRONG!!!!!!!!!!! FIX CUSTOMER AND ORDER MANAGEMNT. BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE IS NOT WELL DESIGNED AND IS THE SAME FOR SALES ADN EMILY THAT IS WORNG. SETTINGS AND SYSTEM CONFIGURATION SHOULD MATCH NAMES. THEN GIVE AN OPTION TO JUST SWITHCH ACCOUNTS NOT LOG OTU. NOW LWTS LOOK AT MANAGER ACCOUNT. . why does everyone have an eb icon when theyre name isnt EB?????????THE DASHBPARDS ARE BASIC REGURTITATIONS THE ADMIN MENU DOESNT REFLECT THE ACTUAL PAGE ALL THE SAME EXACT ISSUES OMG AND THIS IS OUR MAIN PRIORITY
