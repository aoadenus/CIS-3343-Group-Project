Here are 20 additional focused, practical backend/admin improvements for your locked-design prototype, emphasizing functionality, connectability, and demo admin usability consistent with the CIS 3343 Group Project constraints:

31. **Order Payment Balances View**  
Summarize remaining balance and total paid per order for quick reference.

32. **Order Deposit Tracking**  
Mark orders with required/min deposit (50%) flag; visually mark if deposit met.

33. **Soft Delete with Restore Option**  
Allow admins to soft-delete customers/orders and restore within session to prevent accidental loss.

34. **Order Inquiries Summary Tab**  
Aggregate all customer inquiries per order into a single view for admin review.

35. **Admin Commenting/Notes on Customer Profile**  
Staff can add internal-only notes on customer profiles, not visible to customers.

36. **Restrict Order Editing Past Baking Stage**  
Lock order fields from edits once baking starts with clear visual indication.

37. **Customer Contact Info Validation**  
Basic checks on email format and phone number length when creating/updating customers.

38. **Filter Orders by Deposit Status**  
Allow filtering order list by deposit paid, unpaid status.

39. **Guest Customer Flagging**  
Mark customers created without full contact info as "Guest" with limited editable fields.

40. **Order Detail Quick Access Links**  
Add “Jump to Order Details” links from customer or payment lists.

41. **Simple Printable Invoice Generation**  
Generate basic printable order invoice for admin use with customer, order, payment details.

42. **Order Cancellation Reason Input**  
Require user-entered reason when canceling orders for audit purposes.

43. **Email/Open Status Tracking for Inquiries**  
Record when inquiries are viewed or responded to by admin.

44. **Payment Adjustment Logs**  
Log changes to payment amounts/status with admin user and timestamp.

45. **Basic Staff User Management**  
Option to add demo staff user accounts with simple password auth (no full RBAC).

46. **Order Aging Indicator**  
Flag orders older than set threshold (e.g., 7 days) in admin list.

47. **Automatic Date Formatting**  
Consistent display of date fields in admin panel (MM/DD/YYYY).

48. **Consistent Error Response Structure**  
Backend returns standardized error codes/messages for client-side handling.

49. **Minimal SSL/TLS Enforcement**  
Ensure all admin endpoints use HTTPS though no complex cert management needed for prototype.

50. **API Rate Limit Throttling**  
Basic per-user request throttling to prevent accidental API overload during testing.

These reflect the project constraints (locked frontend, demo admins, prototype scale) while adding robustness and polish to backend/admin functionality. If you'd like, I can also prepare focused implementation steps or example code snippets for any of these.
