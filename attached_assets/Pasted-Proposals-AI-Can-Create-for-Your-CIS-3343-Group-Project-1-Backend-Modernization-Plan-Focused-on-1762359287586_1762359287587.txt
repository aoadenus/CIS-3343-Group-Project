Proposals AI Can Create for Your CIS 3343 Group Project

1. Backend Modernization Plan (Focused on CIS 3343 Specs)

Goal: Upgrade the backend codebase for the GitHub-hosted CIS 3343 prototype, ensuring code is reusable, consistent, and testable.

Steps:

Examine the current Node.js/Express backend and PostgreSQL schema.

Identify database improvements, like separating product options into flexible, normalized tables (for cakes, flavors, etc.).

Refactor the backend API (add endpoints for complete CRUD—Create, Read, Update, Delete—for employees, customers, and orders).

Add robust input validation and enforce all business and assignment rules (e.g., only valid customer types, enforce relationships between orders and users).

Write automated tests using real and mock data to verify all changes before deployment.

Jargon explained:

CRUD: Operations that let you Create, Read, Update, and Delete entries in your database.

Input validation: Checking that all data entering your system is clean, correct, and safe.

2. Frontend-Backend Sync Plan (Within Design-Locked Rules)

Goal: Enhance backend while keeping customer-facing pages (nav bar, homepage, menu, shop, custom builder, gallery) locked as required by CIS 3343 process.

Steps:

Implement APIs so that the shop and builder pages always load catalog/product info dynamically from the backend—do not hardcode options.

Document API data contracts so the frontend (even when locked) always matches the backend (“single source of truth”).

Use JSON schemas and Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for technical clarity.

Why? Ensures design consistency—frontend always matches real-time backend inventory.

3. Full Role-Based Back-End Interfaces Proposal

Goal: Add dashboards for each user type (baker, accountant, manager), backed by the same API but with role-based permissions.

Steps:

Use a “role” field in the PostgreSQL employee table to track who has access to what features.

Set up permission “middleware” in Express.js—checking user roles before any sensitive API route runs.

Provide technical wireframes/prototypes in Canva or Figma for internal documentation (these do not alter locked customer interfaces).

Example: Bakers see a simplified queue and update statuses; accountants manage payments; managers see reports.
