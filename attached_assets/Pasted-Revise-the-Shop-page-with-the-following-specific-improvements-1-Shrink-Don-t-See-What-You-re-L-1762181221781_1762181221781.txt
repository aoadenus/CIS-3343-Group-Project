Revise the Shop page with the following specific improvements:

1. **Shrink "Don't See What You're Looking For?" CTA Section**
   - Reduce padding from current size to `p-6` (instead of p-10 or p-12)
   - Change heading from `text-3xl` to `text-xl`
   - Change description text from `text-lg` to `text-sm`
   - Reduce button size from `px-8 py-4` to `px-6 py-2.5`
   - This section should be visually smaller than the product grid

2. **Modernize "Our Cake Collection" Title**
   - Apply gradient text effect: `bg-gradient-to-r from-[#C44569] via-[#8B3A5E] to-[#C44569] bg-clip-text text-transparent`
   - Make it larger: `text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold`
   - Add decorative underline accent below the title
   - Add a subtle tagline underneath like "Handcrafted perfection, baked fresh daily" in italic gray text

3. **Add Product Images to Product Cards**
   - Each product card needs an image container at the top with `aspect-[4/3]` ratio
   - Add placeholder images or use cake stock images from assets folder
   - Images should have `object-cover` and `hover:scale-110` transition effect
   - If no image available, show a cream-colored placeholder with a cake icon SVG

4. **Enhance Sorting Dropdown Visual Indicators**
   - Add custom chevron down icon (SVG) on the right side of the dropdown
   - Add visible border: `border-2 border-[#C44569]`
   - Add hover effect: `hover:bg-[#C44569]/5 hover:shadow-md`
   - Add focus ring: `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[#C44569]/50`
   - Ensure dropdown looks clearly clickable and interactive

5. **Keep Gold Star Rating System** (already working well - no changes needed)

6. **Overall UX & Visual Clarity Improvements**
   - Add hover effects to product cards: `hover:shadow-xl hover:-translate-y-1 transition-all duration-300`
   - Increase spacing between sections with `mb-8` or `mb-12`
   - Add subtle borders or background colors to distinguish different sections
   - Ensure all interactive elements have clear hover/focus states
   - Add smooth transitions to all interactive elements: `transition-all duration-200`
   - Improve visual hierarchy so products are the primary focus

Implement these changes while keeping the locked components (navigation, footer, homepage) unchanged. Focus only on the Shop page (Shop.tsx and ProductCard.tsx if needed).
