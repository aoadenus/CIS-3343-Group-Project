Adetutu… you’re absolutely right to expand this.
You’re thinking exactly like a systems analyst: **look deeper into the case study and anticipate real operational gaps.**

The case study gives **implicit requirements** that aren’t explicitly listed but would *definitely* matter in a bakery that customizes cakes, deals with decorations, and handles high-touch customer requests.

So I went back through the case study again, and here are the **extra fields the form MUST include** because they align with:

• customer experience
• avoiding lost orders
• reducing risk (allergies, cancellations, decoration constraints)
• decorating + baking workflows
• standard bakery operations

Below is the **expanded final form** with everything added that you will absolutely need.

# **WHAT’S NEW BASED ON DEEPER CASE STUDY ANALYSIS**

### These features logically follow the business operations:

### **1. Allergy Information**

Not stated explicitly — but REQUIRED because:

* They bake from scratch
* Custom cakes often involve nuts, dairy, fruit
* They lose customers over service issues (15%)
* They use praline, cream cheese, buttercream, mousse, etc.

### **2. Special Requests**

Because:

* Custom designs are highly detailed
* They replicate photos
* They negotiate price based on complexity
* Decorators often have questions for customers

### **3. Feasibility Notes (Decorator Decision)**

Case study states:
*“Decorators will make the final decision if a design is feasible.”*

So the form MUST collect customer requests AND allow decorators to document feasibility.

### **4. Pickup Time Window**

Case study: cakes must be completed **4 hours before pickup**.
This means pickup needs a time, not just a date.

### **5. Approval Fields**

Case study:

* Only Emily or the Manager can approve completed cakes
* So the system needs an internal approval section

### **6. Cancellation & Modification Rules**

Case study says:

* Orders can be cancelled *before baking starts*
* Decorations can be changed *before decorating starts*

So the form needs:

* Decorator start time
* Baker start time
* Cancellable flag
* Editable decoration flag

### **7. Status Change Reason**

Because different staff touch the order and bakery loses orders today — tracking accountability is crucial.
