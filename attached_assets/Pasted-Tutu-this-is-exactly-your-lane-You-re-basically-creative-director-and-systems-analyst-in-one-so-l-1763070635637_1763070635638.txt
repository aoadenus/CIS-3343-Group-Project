Tutu, this is exactly your lane. You’re basically creative director and systems analyst in one, so let’s treat this like a real redesign brief.

I’ll do three things:

1. Set a **clean global layout + design system** for the staff app.
2. Design **role-based dashboards** and fix your UX pain points structurally.
3. Outline **all the core pages** (orders, customers, products, inquiries, BI, settings) in a developer-friendly way.

You can hand this straight to your dev teammate or use it to refactor your Replit project.

---

## 1. Global Layout & Design System

### 1.1 Global Layout

Use a standard, predictable app shell:

* **Top Bar**

  * Left: Logo + system name: “Emily Bakes Cakes Staff Portal”
  * Center: Page title (matches menu item exactly)
  * Right:

    * Current user avatar + name
    * Role badge (Sales, Baker, Decorator, Manager, Accountant)
    * “Switch Account” option
    * Settings icon

* **Left Sidebar Navigation** (persistent)

  * Role-aware. Items only show if the role can actually use them.
  * Example items:

    * Dashboard
    * Orders
    * Customers
    * Inquiries
    * Product Catalog
    * Reports
    * Settings
  * Highlight the current page with:

    * Bold text
    * Accent bar on the left
    * Background tint

* **Content Area**

  * Top: Breadcrumbs

    * Example: `Dashboard / Orders / Order #1045`
  * Middle: Page content (cards, tables, forms)
  * Bottom: Short status hints or last update time

* **Feedback**

  * Success and error toasts in top right for:

    * Order created
    * Status updated
    * Form validation issues

This immediately fixes:

* Menu / page title mismatch
* No breadcrumb trail
* Confusion about where you are in the app

---

### 1.2 Visual Design & Components

**Color Theme (subtle, bakery-professional):**

* Primary: Soft Pink `#FFC0CB`
* Accent 1: Royal Blue `#0033A0` (buttons, links)
* Accent 2: Gold `#FFD700` (primary actions)
* Background: `#F9FAFB`
* Cards: `#FFFFFF` with light shadow
* Text: `#111827` (blackish)
* Muted Text: `#6B7280`

**Components:**

* **Card**: Rounded corners, title, optional icon, content area, footer for actions.

* **Table**: Striped rows, sticky header, clear sorting icons, hover highlight.

* **Buttons**:

  * Primary: Gold with dark text (`Create Order`, `Save Changes`)
  * Secondary: White with border (`Cancel`, `Back`)

* **Dropdowns**:

  * Label above
  * Full-width input
  * Clear arrow on the right

* **Modals**:

  * Max width 600–800px
  * Dimmed background
  * Title, content, primary + secondary actions
  * Always has a visible close “X” in the top right

These patterns fix:

* Modal cut-off issues
* Dropdown alignment problems
* Overall “cute but not functional” feel

## 2. Role-Based Dashboards

There are really four important dashboards:

1. Sales Dashboard
2. Baker / Decorator Production Dashboard
3. Manager / Owner Business Dashboard
4. Accountant / Reports View (lighter, mostly data)

### 2.1 Sales Dashboard

**Route:** `/sales-dashboard`
**Menu Label:** “Sales Dashboard”
**Page Title:** “Sales Dashboard”

**Layout:**

1. **Row 1 – KPIs (4 cards)**

   * “New Orders Today”
   * “Upcoming Pickups (Next 48h)”
   * “Deposits Collected Today”
   * “Outstanding Balances”

2. **Row 2 – Quick Actions (Buttons / small cards)**

   * “Create Custom Order”
   * “Add New Customer”
   * “View Today’s Orders”
   * “View Inquiries”

3. **Row 3 – Today’s Orders Table**

   * Columns: Time, Customer, Cake, Size, Status, Balance Due, Actions
   * Actions: “View”, “Print Ticket”

4. **Row 4 – Inquiries & Alerts**

   * Left: List of new inquiries (convert to order)
   * Right: Alerts

     * “Order missing deposit”
     * “Rush order flagged”

**Permissions:**

* Can create orders
* Can edit customer info
* Cannot change order status beyond “New”

This addresses:

* Sales workflow clarity
* Lost orders due to confusion
* Hidden quick actions

---

### 2.2 Baker / Decorator Dashboard

**Route:** `/production-dashboard`
**Label:** “Production”
**Title:** “Production Dashboard”

**Layout:**

1. **Row 1 – KPIs**

   * “Orders In Baking”
   * “Orders In Decorating”
   * “Due in Next 4 Hours”
   * “Overdue Orders”

2. **Row 2 – Kanban Board**
   Columns:

   * New (read-only)
   * Pending Baking
   * In Baking
   * Ready for Decorating
   * In Decorating
   * Ready for Approval

   Each card:

   * Customer name
   * Pickup time
   * Cake size / flavour
   * Allergy icon
   * Rush tag if applicable

   Bakers and Decorators can drag cards between allowed columns. That visually enforces status flow.

3. **Row 3 – Order Details Drawer**

   * When a card is clicked, open a slide-in panel from right:

     * Ingredients summary
     * Allergies
     * Special requests
     * Inspiration image previews
     * Notes

Status updates from this dashboard are controlled by role. Sales cannot even reach these states.

---

### 2.3 Manager / Owner Dashboard

**Route:** `/manager-dashboard`
**Label:** “Management”
**Title:** “Management Dashboard”

**Layout:**

1. **Row 1 – Business KPIs**

   * “Total Orders This Week”
   * “Custom Orders vs Standard”
   * “Average Order Value”
   * “Returning Customers This Month”

2. **Row 2 – Approvals Queue**

   * Table: Orders that are “Awaiting Approval”
   * Columns: Customer, Pickup Time, Decorator, Photos, Status, Approve/Reject
   * Manager clicks “Approve” to change status to “Ready for Pickup”

3. **Row 3 – Risk & Issues**

   * Left card: “Orders at Risk” (less than 4 hours to pickup and not finished)
   * Right card: “Complaints or Red Flags” (optional future enhancement)

4. **Row 4 – Quick Links**

   * Manage staff accounts
   * Edit products & prices
   * Download weekly report (PDF/CSV)

This answers:

* Sponsor’s focus on efficiencies
* “Manager must approve completed cakes” rule

---

### 2.4 Accountant / Reports View

**Route:** `/reports`
**Label:** “Reports”
**Title:** “Financial & Operations Reports”

* Filters for date range and type of report
* Report cards:

  * Deposits vs Final Payments
  * Revenue per product category
  * Outstanding balances
  * Returning customer count

Accountant role is mostly read-only.

---

## 3. Core Page Designs

Now let’s design the other pages you complained about to remove every UX bug.

---

### 3.1 Orders Page

**Route:** `/orders`
**Label:** “Orders”
**Title:** “Orders”

**Top section: Filters**

* Search bar: customer name, phone, order id
* Status filter: multi-select chips
* Date range (pickup date)
* Role filter (last touched by: Sales, Baker, Decorator)

**Main content: Orders Table**

* Columns:

  * Order ID
  * Customer
  * Pickup date & time
  * Product summary
  * Status (colored pill)
  * Last updated by (staff name)
  * Actions: View | Edit (if permitted)

**Row click → Order Detail View**

* Opens a right drawer or separate page:

  * All details from the custom order form
  * Timeline of status changes:

    * “09:15 – Sales created order”
    * “12:03 – Baker moved to In Baking”

This fixes:

* Confusing order list
* No visibility into who did what
* Misalignment of dropdowns and icons

---

### 3.2 Custom Order Creation Page

**Route:** `/orders/new`
**Title:** “Create Custom Order”

Use the improved form we already built, with:

* Section headings and progress:

  * Customer → Cake → Colors & Decorations → Payment → Review & Save
* Show a **sticky summary card** on the right:

  * Cake size, flavor, fillings, price, deposit

Validation:

* Disable “Create Order” until required fields are filled
* Show inline validation messages, not just alerts

---

### 3.3 Customers Page

**Route:** `/customers`
**Title:** “Customers”

**Top:**

* “Add New Customer” button
* Search + filters (Retail / Corporate, Preferred only)

**Main Table:**

* Name
* Type
* Preferred (badge)
* Phone
* Email
* Total orders
* Last order date
* Actions: View, Edit

**Customer Detail Page:**

* Left: Profile info and tags (Retail / Corporate / Preferred)
* Right: Tabbed view:

  * Orders
  * Contact history
  * Notes
  * Marketing preferences

This ties into the “increase returning customers by 15 percent” requirement.

---

### 3.4 Product Catalog Page

**Route:** `/products`
**Title:** “Product Catalog”

Grid or table of products:

* Product name
* Category (Cake, Cupcake, etc.)
* Size / serving range
* Base price
* Active / Inactive toggle

Top right: “Add Product” button.

This replaces the improper “Inventory Management” page and keeps the scope correct.

---

### 3.5 Inquiries Page

**Route:** `/inquiries`
**Title:** “Inquiries”

**Top Row:**

* Filters: New, In Progress, Converted, Closed
* Search by email / name

**Main Table:**

* Date
* Name
* Contact info
* Message preview
* Rush indicator (if rush)
* Status
* Action: “Convert to Order”

When “Convert to Order” is clicked:

* Pre-fill customer info in new custom order form
* Attach original inquiry as note

This solves:

* “Why do we have no inquiries?”
* “Where is rush order routing?”

---

### 3.6 Reports / Business Intelligence Page

**Route:** `/reports`

Use panels, not one generic chart.

* Filter bar: date range, role view (Owner, Sales, Production)
* Cards:

  * Sales over time chart
  * Product popularity bar chart
  * New vs returning customers pie chart
  * Top 10 customers table

Different roles see content tailored to them. That solves the issue of BI being the same for Sales and Emily.

---

### 3.7 Settings & Account Switching

**Route:** `/settings`
**Title:** “Settings”

**Tabs:**

* Profile (name, avatar, contact)
* Security (password)
* Role & Permissions (Manager only)
* System Options (Manager only)

In the top bar:

* User avatar click → dropdown menu:

  * View Profile
  * Switch Account
  * Logout

“Switch Account” should bring up a small modal with a list of demo accounts (Emily, James, Sales Staff, Baker, Decorator) so that during presentations you can jump roles quickly.

---

## 4. Specific Bug Fixes Mapped To Design

Let’s map your original complaints directly to fixes:

1. **KPI dashboards not informative / quick actions hidden**
   → KPIs always in row 1, quick actions in row 2, tables below.

2. **Menu vs page title mismatch (“Business Analytics” vs “Sales Dashboard”)**
   → Every route has one name used consistently in menu, URL, and header.

3. **Orders categorized by occasion**
   → Remove “occasion” everywhere. Orders categorized by status, date, and customer.

4. **Custom cake builder layers / 1 layer option**
   → Layer count dropdown minimum 2.

5. **No breadcrumbs**
   → Standard breadcrumb bar under header on all pages.

6. **Sales moving orders to Pending**
   → Role rules: Sales only create; production roles handle status.

7. **Dropdown alignment with weird icons**
   → Single standard dropdown component with left label and right arrow.

8. **Popups too big, no cancel icon, cut off**
   → Constrained modal width, internal scroll, always show close icon.

9. **Inventory vs product scope**
   → Page renamed to Product Catalog, inventory fields removed.

10. **Business Intelligence same for all roles**
    → Role-specific BI views on Reports and Dashboards.

11. **Settings / System Configuration naming confusion**
    → Single “Settings” section with inner tabs.

12. **No easy account switching**
    → Avatar dropdown with “Switch Account”.

13. **Everyone has “eb” icon**
    → Avatar initials with color or uploadable photo.

---

If you want, next step I can:

* Turn this into a **page-by-page component tree** for React (with suggested file structure).
* Or generate **Figma-style text prompts** so you can feed them to Gamma / Figma AI and get instant wireframes.
* Or create a **QA test checklist** for each page to verify all UX fixes before your next deploy.

You tell me which one you want, and we go straight there.
