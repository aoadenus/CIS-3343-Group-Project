When i select my link: https://a721f5a2-26f7-49c5-8928-423f82d41ffd-00-26tii9ec4y849.janeway.replit.dev/ the webpage opens and a quick loading circle is shown with loading text. I notice the home pages image is not visible, i then aatempt to scroll through home page, usking keyboard down error and had no response, i used my finger as this is a touchscreen laptop and scrolling works, trying to use the mouse to use scroll bar doesnt work. Next I try to use my finger to select shop page, there is no response. I try to use my mouse and there is no response. I reload screen and website stays loading for 30 seconds and then page goes unresponsive giving wait or exit pages option. I have include 5 har files. and a screenshot of home page. The har files include network log of reptil site, and the log for 4 different attempts to load project.

Thank you for providing these details - this helps clarify the actual problem. This sounds like a complete JavaScript crash rather than just slow navigation. Let me check the current logs to see what's happening:

Checked console and system logs
The logs show no JavaScript errors, but your symptoms suggest a complete application freeze. Let me examine the current App.tsx structure to see if the lazy loading changes broke something:

Let me check if the page exports match the lazy imports:

Based on your detailed description and the HAR files, I can now see the real problem. This isn't a slow transition - the entire application is completely frozen/crashed. Here's what's happening:

Issue Summary for Replit Support
Critical Problem: Complete Application Freeze on External URL
Symptoms:

Page loads with loading spinner, then becomes completely unresponsive
Home page background image not visible
All JavaScript interactions frozen (navigation buttons don't respond to clicks)
Mouse interactions don't work (can't use scrollbar, can't click links)
Keyboard interactions don't work (arrow keys don't scroll)
Touch scrolling works (native browser feature, doesn't require JS)
After reload: 30-second hang, then browser shows "Page Unresponsive" dialog
Network HAR files show zero entries - requests aren't completing
Root Cause: Lazy loading implementation with React.lazy() and Suspense appears to be failing in production/external URL environment

What Was Attempted
1. Bundle Size Optimization (November 4)

Changed Vite base path from './' to '/' to fix 404 errors
Result: Fixed asset loading but didn't resolve freeze
2. Manual Code Splitting

Configured Vite manualChunks to split vendor/UI/motion libraries
Result: Reduced bundle but didn't fix interaction freeze
3. React Lazy Loading (Current - May Have Broken App)

Implemented React.lazy() for all public and admin pages
Added Suspense boundaries wrapping PublicLayout/AdminLayout
Result: App now completely frozen - may have broken the application entirely
Technical Configuration
// Current broken state in App.tsx
const PublicHome = lazy(() => import('./pages/public/Home').then(m => ({ default: m.PublicHome })));
// Suspense wrapping layout
<Suspense fallback={<PageLoader />}>
  <PublicLayout>
    <motion.div key={activePage}>
      {renderPublicPage()} // Returns lazy-loaded component
    </motion.div>
  </PublicLayout>
</Suspense>
Framework: React 18.3.1 + Vite 6.3.5 + TypeScript
Deployment: Replit Autoscale (port 5000 → external URL)
Build Tool: Vite with code splitting enabled

Suspected Issues
Lazy loading chunks failing to load on external Replit URLs (network requests not completing)
Suspense fallback not rendering properly in iframe environment
Hydration mismatch between server and client
React event listeners not attaching due to lazy loading failure
Immediate Action Needed
The lazy loading implementation appears to have completely broken the application. We need to revert the lazy loading changes and go back to the working state before React.lazy() was added.

Would you like me to create a plan to:

Revert all lazy loading changes to restore the working application
Test the external URL to confirm it works again
Find an alternative solution for the original navigation delay issue that doesn't break the app?
