Emily Bakes Cakes – Admin Prototype Diagnostic Report

Prepared by: Adetutu (Tutu) Adenusi – Student ID: 2180098
Role: CIS Student Analyst and QA Lead

0. Executive Summary

After a deep test of the entire Staff Application (Admin Portal), it’s clear the current build looks visually “cute” but does not function in a way that supports Emily Bakes Cakes’ real operational workflow.

The prototype is failing in three major areas:

It does not match the case study requirements.

UI/UX is inconsistent, confusing, and not business-grade.

Role-based permissions, dashboards, navigation, and data structures are incorrect or incomplete.

This system needs a serious correction sprint before presentation.

1. Dashboard & KPIs
Issue

The dashboards are not actionable.
Critical elements — Quick Links, System Overview, Alerts — are hidden below the fold.
Sales Dashboard title does not match the menu (“Business Analytics”).
Charts look cute but serve no real business logic.

Recommendation

Move Quick Actions, System Overview, and Alerts to the top.

Change menu wording to match page titles (“Sales Dashboard,” “Order Overview,” etc.).

Create role-specific dashboards:

Sales: Today’s orders, customer spending, inquiries.

Baker: Cakes in production, due today, overdue items.

Owner: Revenue, order trends, customer retention.

2. Menu & Navigation
Issue

Menu labels feel unprofessional and don’t match the pages.
Breadcrumb navigation is missing, causing users to get “stuck.”

Recommendation

Replace “Business Analytics” with “Sales Dashboard.”

Add breadcrumb trail:

Dashboard > Orders > Order #1293

Highlight menu item based on active page (route-based highlighting).

3. Order Management Issues
A. Occasion Problem

“Occasion” should NOT exist anywhere.
Case study explicitly removes it.

Fix

Remove “Occasion” from:

Custom Cake Builder

Order creation

Order filters

Order cards

Order detail view

Database schema (if applicable)

B. Layer Selection

A 1-layer cake makes zero sense.

Fix

Minimum: 2 layers

Maximum: 4 layers

Enforce validation logic in UI + backend.

C. Design Style

“Design Style” is not part of Emily’s business rules.

Fix

Completely remove it.

4. Role Permissions: Sales, Baker, Decorator, Owner
Issue

Sales staff can move orders to “Pending.”
That is out of scope and breaks workflow.

Correct Logic

Sales: can create orders and view orders.

Baker/Decorator: can change order status.

Manager/Owner: can override, approve, reassign.

Fix

Lock status dropdown for Sales roles.

Only show allowed actions for each role.

5. Order & Customer Popups
Issue

Popups are massive, cut off, and impossible to close.
Close icon sometimes missing.
Elements overlap or overflow.

Recommendation

Reduce popup width to 60% screen.

Limit height and enable scroll inside modal.

Always include top-right “X” close button.

Center modal properly.

6. Dropdown UI Problems
Issue

Dropdown icons are misaligned and extremely confusing.
Icons appear on far left, text on right, spacing is off.

Recommendation

Use standard UI:

[ Label ] [ v ]


Left-align labels

Right-align dropdown arrow

Add spacing of 12–16px

Increase font-weight

Use modern standardized component patterns

7. Inquiry System + Rush Orders
Issue

Inquiry page is empty, non-functional, missing rush-order logic.

Recommendation

Add standard inquiry list (Name, Email, Message, Date).

Add search & filter.

Add “Rush Order” indicator (boolean).

Add “Respond” or “Convert to Order” button.

8. Inventory Management (Out of Scope)
Issue

Staff are handling inventory. That is NOT part of the case study.

Fix

Rename to:

“Product Catalog” OR

“Products”

What’s allowed:

CRUD products

View all product types used in custom cakes

What’s NOT allowed:

Stock levels

Inventory counts

Warehouse items

Supply management

9. Customer Management Issues
Issue

Customer pages are oversized, poorly aligned, and inconsistent.

Fix

Standardize spacing, padding, headers, tables.

Make it responsive.

Use same modal size rules as Order Management.

10. Business Intelligence (BI)
Issue

BI page is identical for Sales and Owner.
This is wrong and not role-based.

Fix

Owner: revenue, customer trends, year-over-year performance.

Sales: customer spending, daily orders, conversion.

Baker: orders due, production load.

11. Settings + System Configuration
Issue

Pages are poorly named and inconsistent.

Fix

Use:

“Settings”

“System Configuration”

“User Accounts”

“Roles & Permissions”

And apply those names everywhere.

12. Account Switching
Issue

User must fully log out to switch accounts.

Fix

Add:
“Switch Account” → opens quick switch modal (useful in bakery shared devices).

13. Manager Account Branding
Issue

Every user has an “eb” icon.
Unclear who is who.

Fix

Use initials:

Emily Baker → EB

John Smith → JS

Add custom colors for avatar backgrounds

Add ability to upload profile picture

14. Prototype-Wide Dashboard Repetition
Issue

All dashboards repeat the same generic cards.
Not useful for any role.

Fix

Create four unique dashboards:

Sales Dashboard

Order Dashboard (Baker/Decorator)

Owner Dashboard

Admin System Overview Dashboard

15. Admin Menu Does Not Reflect Page State
Issue

Menu selection stays the same no matter what page you're on.

Fix

Route-based highlighting:

“Sales Dashboard” highlights when you are on /sales-dashboard

“Orders” highlights when you are on /orders
