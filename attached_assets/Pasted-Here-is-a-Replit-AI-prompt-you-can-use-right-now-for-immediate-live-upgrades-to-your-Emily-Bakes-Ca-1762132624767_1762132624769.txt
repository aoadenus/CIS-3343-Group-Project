**Goal:** Make your site visually stunning and interactive instantly, without any backend dependencies.

**Features To Add Right Now:**  

- Hero banner with smooth, elegant parallax and fade-in animations using Framer Motion.  
- Interactive product and order cards with hover effects and clickable quick actions (edit, view history).  
- Smart search bar with autosuggest that filters mock data in real time.  
- Drag-and-drop order priority board implemented in React DnD using local state and mock orders.  
- Toggle button to switch between demo data sets and realistic randomized fake data for dynamic feel.  
- Responsive navigation menus and footer with full keyboard accessibility and ARIA labels.  
- Recharts/Chart.js interactive charts embedded with live sample data (sales trends, top products, customer segments) featuring animated transitions.  
- Print-friendly styles for invoices and reports toggled by a button.  

**How This Works:**  

- All data resides in frontend state or JSON files—no backend calls needed, fully functional in-browser.  
- Immediate polished UI polish to impress users and create a modern, dynamic experience.  
- Sets the groundwork to integrate backend APIs seamlessly in future iterations.

3. Embed example Recharts/Chart.js chart components keyed to sample data, with tooltips and drill-down UI.  
4. Add keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes to all interactive elements for accessibility.  
5. Implement CSS print media rules toggled by a button to switch to invoice/report style.
