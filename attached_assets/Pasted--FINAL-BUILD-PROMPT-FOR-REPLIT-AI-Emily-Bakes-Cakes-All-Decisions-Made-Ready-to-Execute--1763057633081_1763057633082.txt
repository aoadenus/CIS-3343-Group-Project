## 📋 DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS PER DECISION

### 1. GOOGLE MAPS ON CONTACT PAGE
**Decision:** Embed (no API key, fastest)
\`\`\`html
<iframe 
  src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3024.1234567890!2d-118.2437!3d34.0522!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x80c2c75ddc27d001%3A0x0!2sEmily%20Bakes%20Cakes!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v..."
  width="100%" 
  height="400" 
  style="border:0;" 
  allowFullScreen="" 
  loading="lazy"
/>
\`\`\`
**Replace coordinates with:** Your actual bakery address (or hardcode: "123 Baker St, Your City")

### 2. CONTACT FORM STORAGE
**Decision:** Email + Database
\`\`\`typescript
// On form submit:
1. Validate all fields
2. Save to database: contact_messages table
3. Send email via Resend to: your-email@gmail.com
4. Show success message: "✓ Message sent! We'll be in touch."
5. Optionally: Enable staff to view messages in /admin/contact-messages page
\`\`\`

### 3. TRACKING PAGE AUTO-CYCLE
**Decision:** 2 minutes per status
\`\`\`
Timeline:
Received (0:00-2:00) → 
Baking (2:00-4:00) → 
Decorating (4:00-6:00) → 
Quality Check (6:00-7:00) → 
Ready for Pickup (7:00+)

Total cycle: ~7 minutes, then stays at "Ready"
Refresh on page: Show current status based on time calculation
\`\`\`

### 4. TRACKING PAGE TIMERS
**Decision:** Real elapsed time + estimated completion
\`\`\`
Display format:
"⏱️ Elapsed: 45 minutes
 ⏳ Estimated Complete: 2:30 PM (1 hour 15 min remaining)"

Logic:
- Start time: When baker clicked "Start Baking" (from database)
- Est. completion: based on cake size + layer count (hardcoded estimates)
- Update every 10 seconds in real-time
\`\`\`

### 5. STAFF PERMISSIONS
**Decision:** 
- Sales sees ALL orders (for coordination)
- Baker/Decorator NO revenue KPIs (only see their assigned orders)
- Accountant/Manager see everything

\`\`\`typescript
// Permission Matrix:
Permission              | Sales | Baker | Decorator | Accountant | Manager
Create Orders           | ✓     | ✗     | ✗         | ✗          | ✓
View All Orders         | ✓     | ✗     | ✗         | ✓          | ✓
View Own Orders Only    | -     | ✓     | ✓         | -          | -
Edit Order Status       | ✗     | ✓*    | ✓*        | ✗          | ✓
(*own only)
View Revenue/KPIs       | ✗     | ✗     | ✗         | ✓          | ✓
Manage Staff/Products   | ✗     | ✗     | ✗         | ✗          | ✓
\`\`\`

### 6. EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS
**Decision:** On order creation
\`\`\`
Trigger: When Sales staff clicks "Confirm & Create Order"

Email to customer:
From: noreply@emilybakes.com
Subject: "Your Emily Bakes Cakes Order Confirmed - #Q1-001"
Body:
  Order #Q1-001 Confirmed!
  Customer: John Doe
  Pickup: Tomorrow, 2:00 PM
  
  Cake Details:
  - Size: 10"
  - Layers: 3 (Vanilla, Chocolate, Red Velvet)
  - Icing: Cream Cheese Frosting
  - Colors: Pink, Gold, White
  - Special: "Happy 30th Birthday!"
  
  Price: $95.00
  Deposit Paid: $50.00
  Balance Due: $45.00
  
  📍 Track Your Order:
  [emilybakes.com/track/TRK-Q1-001]
  
  Questions? Call (555) 123-4567

Method: Resend API (already installed in your project)
\`\`\`

### 7. CAKE LAYER FLEXIBILITY
**Decision:** Completely flexible (any combination)
\`\`\`
Rules:
- Min layers: 1
- Max layers: 7 (no limit per case study, but 7 is practical max)
- Each layer can be different:
  * Flavor: (Vanilla, Chocolate, Red Velvet, Lemon, Almond, German Chocolate)
  * Filling: (Cream Cheese, Chocolate Ganache, Raspberry Jam, Buttercream)
  * Icing: (Buttercream, Fondant, Ganache, Cream Cheese)
  * Color: (White, Pink, Blue, Gold, Green, Purple, Red, Yellow)
- No restrictions (manager can override if needed)
- All combinations allowed
\`\`\`

### 8. DEPOSIT CALCULATION
**Decision:** Auto-calculate 50% (enforces business rule)
\`\`\`typescript
// Logic:
firmPrice = user_entered_value (e.g., $95)
depositRequired = firmPrice * 0.5  // Auto-calculated: $47.50
balanceDue = firmPrice - depositRequired

// Can be overridden by manager, but default is 50%
// Validation: Customer must pay at least 50% before confirming order

// On payment form:
- Deposit Amount: [_$_] (editable, but highlights 50% suggestion)
- Validation error if: depositAmount < (firmPrice * 0.5)
- Balance calculated automatically
\`\`\`

### 9. CUSTOMER PHOTOS
**Decision:** URL/link only (teammate handles upload later)
\`\`\`typescript
// In order form, Step 3 (Customization):
Label: "Reference Images (optional)"
Field: Text input for URL
Example: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABC123/view"
         OR "https://pinterest.com/pin/12345/"

// Storage: Save URL as TEXT in orders table
// Display: In order details, show as clickable link
// Phase 2: Replace with actual file upload to AWS S3 / Cloudinary
\`\`\`

### 10. MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS
**Decision:** FULL mobile support (not just desktop/tablet)
\`\`\`
Breakpoints:
- Mobile: 375px - 768px (Tailwind: sm, md)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px (Tailwind: md, lg)
- Desktop: 1024px+ (Tailwind: lg, xl)

All pages must work on:
✓ iPhone 12/13/14 (375px width)
✓ iPad (768px width)
✓ Desktop (1920px)

Key mobile considerations:
- Hamburger menu for navigation
- Stacked forms (no 2-column on mobile)
- Touch-friendly buttons (min 44x44px)
- Images: responsive with srcset
- Tables: card layout on mobile
- Test: Use Chrome DevTools device emulation

## 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Parallel Work:** Backend dev builds API while frontend builds UI (don't wait)
2. **Test Early:** Use Postman for API testing, Chrome DevTools for frontend
3. **Commit Frequently:** GitHub commits every 2 hours (professor sees progress)
4. **Mobile First:** Build responsive from start, don't add at end
5. **Use Libraries:** Recharts, Resend, bcryptjs - don't build from scratch
6. **Mock Data:** If database slow, use mock data for frontend testing
7. **Focus on Demo:** Skip perfection, focus on happy path for walkthrough

---

## 📞 IF YOU GET STUCK

**Reference Documents:**
- Schema: `20_COMPLETE_DATABASE_SETUP.md` (SQL migrations + seed scripts)
- API Spec: `17_DEVELOPER_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` (endpoint contracts)
- Wireframes: `21_FIRST_Complete-Page-Wireframes.md` (exact page layouts)
- UI Guide: `03_UI_STYLE_GUIDE_COMPONENTS.md` (colors, fonts, components)

**Quick Help:**
- JWT auth issue? → Use bcryptjs + jsonwebtoken libraries
- Responsive CSS issue? → Tailwind breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl)
- Email not sending? → Check Resend API key in .env, test with test email first
- Database won't connect? → Verify PostgreSQL running, DATABASE_URL in .env

---

## 🎉 YOU'VE GOT THIS!

**Summary:**
- ✅ All 10 decisions made
- ✅ All specifications clear
- ✅ Wireframes complete
- ✅ 48-hour timeline
- ✅ 6 demo accounts ready
- ✅ Database schema final

**What's left:** Write the code. You have everything you need.
