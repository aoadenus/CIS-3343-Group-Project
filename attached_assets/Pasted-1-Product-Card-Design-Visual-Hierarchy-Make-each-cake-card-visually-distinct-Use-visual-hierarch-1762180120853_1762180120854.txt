1. Product Card Design & Visual Hierarchy
Make each cake card visually distinct. Use visual hierarchy, arrange images and text so the most important info (like “popular” tag, big cake name, price) stands out.
Add hover effects (visual changes when mouse moves over) like shadows or slight zoom on images—use CSS or React libraries like Framer Motion for smooth animations.
2. Ratings & Review UI
Display ratings with star icons (⭐️) and review counts next to each cake. Consider color-coding high-rated items (e.g., 5-star = gold).
Add tooltip popups (small informational boxes) explaining how ratings work.
3. Filtering & Sorting
Interactive filter buttons (e.g., “Most Popular,” “Highest Rated”): give clear visual feedback when selected (highlight with color, transition animation). and small deop down icon, to indicate it is a drop down menu
Sorting: add drop-downs (“Sort by Price,” “Sort by Reviews”) and animate dropdown opening/closing for a polished user experience.
4. Inquire Button & Inquiry Flow
When “Inquire” is clicked, open a modal dialog box (a popup overlay) asking for user info and cake details—this is much clearer than just a notification.
Add input validation (checking that info is filled in correctly, e.g., email format) and show instant feedback (“Thank you for your inquiry!”).
5. Responsiveness (Mobile-Friendly Layout)
Optimize grid layout to shift from multiple columns on desktop to single column on mobile.
Make buttons and images larger on mobile for easier tapping.
6. Accessibility
All images should have alt text (“alternative” description shown for screen readers).
Use strong color contrast and readable fonts for visually impaired users.
7. Performance Optimizations
Compress cake images (use WebP format and lazy loading: only load images when needed).
Use code-splitting in React so only required components (product cards, filters) are loaded for the Shop page—faster page load.
8. Customization Call-to-Action
Add a visually-prominent section at the top: “Don’t see what you’re looking for? Create your custom cake!” with a relavnt sized button.
Briefly explain the custom cake process (select flavor, decoration, delivery date) so users know what to expect.
9. Information Consistency
Standardize how prices and reviews are displayed—always in the same place on every card.
Use tags or badges (“POPULAR,” “NEW”) for cakes in high demand, with different colors for each tag.
10. UI/UX Polish
Add subtle transitions when switching between filters or sorting options—the whole page shouldn’t reload, just the list update (use React state and animation libraries).
Show loading spinners or skeleton UI (placeholder boxes) when data is loading, so it doesn’t appear broken.
MAJOR Ux Polish, ensure the whole shop page looks concise and proffesional
