The updated menu page still falls short of the polish and finesse expected from a platform like Replit. Several issues need to be addressed for better usability and visual appeal:

The button titles do not fit properly inside their buttons, creating a cramped and awkward appearance that disrupts the overall design harmony.

The "Signature Cakes" button includes an unnecessary ">" symbol that adds clutter and confusion, detracting from a clean interface.

While the cake descriptions are informative, there is inadequate space allocated for images, making the layout unbalanced. Furthermore, the description section itself has excessive padding or empty space that should be tightened for a neater look.

The "Cake Flavors" section is acceptable in terms of layout, but the presence of "Available Marks" anywhere on the page is unnecessary and should be completely removed to reduce visual noise.

The primary image at the top of the page is too small and poorly optimized; it needs to be larger and clearer to effectively showcase the product.

Similar sizing and optimization issues affect the "Fillings" section; additionally, check marks used here, as well as in "Icing Types" and "Icing Colors," are redundant and should be removed to streamline the experience.

The image representing icing colors is disproportionately large compared to other elements, which throws off page balance and makes the layout confusing. The hex code message ("🎨 All colors include HEX codes for precise matching") is unnecessary for the user interface and should be eliminated.

Decoration icons are unrealistically tiny and difficult to see; they should be resized or reconsidered altogether for better user interaction.

Icons added to menu titles do not enhance clarity and instead clutter the interface; these should be removed.

The current plus-pattern design element scattered throughout the menu is visually distracting and ugly, especially since the site already has a comprehensive style guide. This pattern should be removed or replaced with something more cohesive and subtle.

Overall, the page feels disorganized and inconsistent with the style guide, calling for a thorough rework of spacing, element sizing, and visual hierarchy to achieve a more professional and user-friendly layout.
