📋 Comprehensive Change List from Walkthrough
Based on the walkthrough transcript, here's a complete breakdown of requested changes for the Create Order Form:

🎯 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Transform the Create Order page from a long, overwhelming scrolling form into a multi-step wizard with progress indicators.

🚨 CRITICAL CHANGES (Must Implement)
1. Multi-Step Form Wizard Structure
Current: Single long scrolling form with all sections stacked vertically
New: Step-by-step wizard with progress indicator

Steps:

Step 1: Customer Selection

Search existing customers OR create new customer
Buttons: "Save" (if creating new) / "Next" (if selecting existing)
Include "Is this a rush order?" checkbox at this step
Step 2: Cake Type Selection

Radio/dropdown: "Standard Cake" vs "Custom Build"
Display 14 standard cakes dropdown (Birthday Celebration, Almond Delight, Lemon & Cream Cheese, Black Forest, German Chocolate, Cream Cheese Chocolate Ganache, Italian Cream, Lemon Doubles, Chocolate Doubles, Half-and-Half, Dori's Lemon & Chocolate Pecan, Pearlene Cream Cheese Chocolate Banana, Chocolate Banana Strawberry Light, Cookies & Cream)
Must have "Next" button after selection
Step 3: Layer Configuration (For both Standard & Custom)

If Standard Cake: Pre-populate layers based on selection, but allow editing
Example: Birthday Celebration = Yellow cake + White buttercream (editable)
User can change from white buttercream → chocolate buttercream while keeping "Birthday Celebration" label
If Custom Build: Empty layer builder
Use dropdown menus for everything (flavors, fillings, colors, decorations)
Add visual layer preview
Step 4: Cake Size & Tiers

Current section is "fine" but needs dropdown menus
Step 5: Design Options

Color schemes (dropdown)
Decorative elements (dropdown)
Writing text and font options (NEW - add font selector for cake writing)
Step 6: Inspiration Images

Upload up to 5 images minimum
Simple file upload interface
Show thumbnails of uploaded images
Step 7: Pricing & Payment

Detailed price breakdown:
Base cake cost (by tier/size)
Layers & filling extra cost (if applicable)
Special decorations cost (itemized)
Total itemized list of what's included
Payment information:
Remove "Pending" status
Keep only: "Partial Deposit", "Paid in Full"
Auto-populate payment fields where possible
If rush order: Skip payment entry temporarily
Step 8: Pickup Information

Pickup date/time
Special instructions
Step 9: Review & Submit

Complete order summary
"Submit Order" button
🔴 HIGH PRIORITY CHANGES
2. Rush Order Handling
Move rush order checkbox to Step 1 (Customer Selection)
If rush order selected:
Show rush indicator throughout wizard
Allow skipping payment information initially
Add "Send as Rush Order" button option
3. Payment Status Simplification
Remove: "Pending" payment status
Keep: "Partial Deposit", "Paid in Full"
Rationale: "We're not going to let anybody not pay for their cake"

4. Admin Management Settings - RBAC
Current: Visible to all roles (Sales staff can see it)
New: Only visible to Manager/Owner roles
Alternative: Remove entirely from Sales staff view

🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS
5. Enhanced Price Display
Show detailed breakdown:

Base cake: "3 tiers - $X.XX"
Filling & layers extra cost: "$X.XX"
Special decorations: "$X.XX per item"
Running total as items are added
Current: Only shows Total Amount, Deposit, Balance Due
New: Full itemized breakdown with explanations

6. Customer Lookup Improvements
Better search functionality
Quick customer creation inline
Display recent/frequent customers
7. Visual Layer Builder
Preview of cake layers as they're added
Visual representation of colors/flavors
Drag-to-reorder layers (maybe)
🟢 REQUIRED VALIDATION & UX IMPROVEMENTS
8. Real-Time Form Validation
Must implement:

As user types - validate immediately
Show green checkmark when field is correct
Show red error when field is wrong
Error highlighting:
Auto-scroll to error field
Highlight error field with red border
Show toast message indicating error location
Specific validations:

Email: "Not a valid email" error
Date: "Must be 2 days from today" error
Rush orders: If date < 2 days, suggest "Request Rush Order" option
9. Dropdown Menu Prioritization
Guideline: "Use dropdown menus as often as possible to stop it from being overwhelming"

Convert these to dropdowns:

Cake flavors
Fillings
Colors
Decorations
Cake sizes
Font options (NEW)
Standard cake selection
📊 FORM FLOW SUMMARY
Before: Long overwhelming form → No progress indicator → Mountain to climb
After:

Multi-step wizard with 9 clear steps
Progress indicator showing current step
"Save & Next" navigation between steps
Dropdowns reduce cognitive load
Real-time validation prevents errors
Visual previews aid decision-making
🎨 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
Progress Indicator: Show steps 1-9 with current step highlighted
Navigation Buttons: "Back", "Save & Next", "Submit Order"
Visual Feedback: Green checkmarks, red errors, loading states
Responsive: Must work on all staff devices
Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, focus management
💼 BUSINESS RULES
Standard cakes can be edited - Pre-populate but allow customization
Rush orders skip initial payment - Can be filled in later
No "Pending" payment status - Only Partial/Paid in Full
Admin settings - Manager/Owner only
Minimum 2-day lead time - Unless rush order requested
5+ inspiration images - Required for complex orders
